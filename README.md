This is to become the newest rendition of the website we use for our semi-annual Parkview Lan. As opposed to previous renditions, this will have active features such as chatrooms (irc backed), user registration, and various administrative capabilities. It will be built using the popular django python web framework in an open-source and collaborative work environment. 

Features
--------

- User Registration
  - PayPal Payment?
- IRC-backed chatrooms
  - KiwiIRC frontend

Development
-----------

Anybody interested in helping with development should make themselves familiar with django and python. All skill levels are welcome, however you must have a willingness to learn.

A simple django introduction can be found at http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/index.html
